# Direct Montage

A simple multitrack audio editor in the browser, in the spirit of Audacity.

## Features

- **Multitrack**: one track per imported file, plus empty tracks to paste into
- **Regions**: copy, cut, paste and delete parts of the audio (later audio
  moves to close or open the gap, like text)
- **Split and move**: split a region at the cursor or at the selection edges,
  then drag it by its top bar, in time or to another track
- **Lengthen or shorten**: drag either end of a region's top bar to show more
  (or less) of its recording
- **Groups**: lock regions together with the padlock so they move as one
- **Volume**: ▼/▲ buttons on the selection change the volume of a region by
  1 dB per click/tap (arrow keys too)
- **Fades**: linear fade in / fade out with a duration typed in seconds
- **Level meter**: peak meter during playback with the -12 dB mark, dashed
  -12 dB guides on every track, and a SAT light when the mix saturates (red
  waveform columns show where a region's volume pushes it past full scale)
- **Mute** per track
- **Undo/redo** for every edit
- **Export** of the mix as WAV (HD, 24-bit / 48 kHz) or MP3 (HD, 320 kbit/s /
  48 kHz)
- **Autosave** of the project in the browser (IndexedDB)
- **Direct Podcast**: recordings shared from Direct Podcast open here

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Web Audio API** for decoding and playback, canvas for the waveforms
- **wasm-media-encoders** (LAME compiled to WebAssembly) for MP3 export, loaded
  only when exporting
- **ESLint** + Prettier

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser

## Usage

1. **Import**: click or drop one or more audio files. Each file becomes a track.
   "Ajouter un fichier son" adds more, "Ajouter une piste vierge" adds an empty
   track.
2. **Select**: drag on a track to select a range (drag across tracks, or on the
   ruler, to select several). Tap to place the cursor. Tap a region's top bar
   or double tap a region to select all of it.
3. **Edit**: Couper / Copier / Coller / Supprimer, Scinder to split.
4. **Move**: drag a region by its top bar. Dropped onto another region, it is
   inserted there and what is in the way slides right. Drag the ends of the
   top bar to lengthen or shorten the region.
5. **Group**: select regions on one or more tracks and press "Grouper" (padlock)
   so they move together; "Dégrouper" separates them.
6. **Volume and fades**: use ▼/▲ on the selection, or type a fade length and
   press Entrée (fade in) or Sortie (fade out). Watch the meter and the -12 dB
   guides while adjusting.
7. **Export**: "Exporter WAV (HD)" or "Exporter MP3 (HD)" downloads the mix of
   the unmuted tracks.

Keyboard: Space play/pause, Ctrl/⌘+X/C/V cut/copy/paste, Delete delete,
S split, Ctrl/⌘+G group, Ctrl/⌘+Shift+G ungroup, ↑/↓ volume, Ctrl/⌘+Z undo,
Ctrl/⌘+Shift+Z redo, +/- zoom.
On touch screens, pinch with two fingers to zoom and slide to scroll.

## Notes

- Editing is non-destructive: regions point into the original audio, which is
  only mixed down on export.
- All processing happens in the browser; audio never leaves the device.
- Long recordings are fully decoded in memory, so very long files can be heavy
  on phones.
